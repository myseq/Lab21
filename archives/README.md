# Lab21 (README.md)

`Lab21` is a series of tutorials created for learning different technologies :technologist:. 

It is mostly developed with  _**DevOps**_ model in mind. 
Each of the tutorial comes with `README.md`, and anyone can follow along.

:cowboy_hat_face: I've invested a lot of my time :hourglass: in _building_ them as small projects, and **make** the improvement happen :sparkler: from time to time.
