# Lab21 (README.md)

`Lab21` is a series of tutorials created for learning different technologies. 

It is mostly developed with  _**DevOps**_ model in mind. 
Each of the tutorial comes with `README.md`, and anyone can follow along.

I've invested a lot of my time :hourglass: in _building_ them as small projects, and **make** the improvement happen from time to time.

## Projects

|    | Code | Project | Year |
| -: | :--- | :------ | :--: |
| 1 | Alpha | Using Ansible playbooks for sysadm operations | 2021 |
| 2 | Beta | Load-balance web servers with `Nginx` | 2022 | 
| 3 | Gamma (incomplete) | **IaaS** infra mgmt operation with dockers and K8s | 2022 |
